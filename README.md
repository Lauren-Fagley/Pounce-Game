# POUNCE

**Pounce** is a fast-paced, horse-racing-themed score tracker for the card game of the same name. Designed to make scorekeeping more fun and visual, Pounce uses AngularJS and custom animations to display game progress with horses racing across the screen. 

This project also served as a personal challenge to improve my **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** skills and to **learn AngularJS** for the first time.
